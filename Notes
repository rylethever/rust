NOTES:
1. Variables are immutable by default. To make it mutable, put mut. Eg. let mut sampleVariable = String::from("Hello World");
2. To reference a mutable variable, put mut after &. Eg. &mut samepleVariable
3. Whenever referencing a variable, it should have an '&'
4. Variables have "Ownership".
5. Constant variables needs to include "type".
6. Arrays doesn't allow dynamic sizing. Use vector instead.
